# neural-network-architecture

This repository contains Python scripts and examples for various neural network architectures and design patterns.

## Contents

- `Basic Feed-Forward Neural Network (MLP)`: A script that demonstrates a basic feed-forward neural network (multilayer perceptron) implementation.
- `Convolutional Neural Network with Custom...`: A script that showcases a convolutional neural network (CNN) with custom layers.
- `cn_example.py`: An example of a convolutional neural network implemented using Python and NumPy.

## Usage

1. Install the required dependencies:
   ```
   pip install numpy
   ```

2. Run the scripts using Python:
   ```
   python script_name.py
   ```

3. Follow the instructions in each script to explore different neural network architectures and design patterns.

## Prerequisites

- Python
- NumPy

## Additional Resources
